# Freshly App - Mobile Application

## Project Overview

### Objective
Develop a mobile application that offers users a diverse range of recipes, personalized suggestions based on user preferences, and the ability to save and organize favorite recipes.

### Scope of Work
The project will include the development of both the frontend and backend of the app, integrating Firebase for real-time database management, user authentication, and API integration for fetching recipe data.

### Expected Outcomes
A fully functional mobile recipe application featuring:
- Personalized recipe feed
- Real-time updates on trending recipes
- Intuitive user interface for smooth navigation
- Easy recipe search, save, and organization functionalities

## Problem Statement
The current market lacks a comprehensive recipe app that combines a vast collection of recipes with personalized recommendations, real-time updates, and an easy-to-use interface for saving and organizing favorites. This project aims to bridge that gap by delivering a complete solution tailored to cooking enthusiasts and home cooks.

## Proposed Solution

### Technologies Used:
- **Flutter**: For cross-platform mobile development.
- **Firebase**: For backend services including real-time database, authentication, and cloud storage.

### System Architecture:
- **Frontend**: Developed using Flutter.
- **Backend**: Managed by Firebase services (Realtime Database for storing user preferences, recipes, etc., and Firebase Authentication for user login/registration).

## Resources Needed

### Hardware/Software:
- Development machines with IDEs such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio
- Firebase access for real-time database, authentication, and cloud storage services
- Testing devices (iOS and Android smartphones)
